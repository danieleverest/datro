Deslinde
~~~~~~~~~~

Property Registration Law (No. 108-05) involving the Deslinde Process. Prior to the enactment of this law, almost all real estate sales were made without a plan approved by the State (“boundary”) because this process took years to complete. However, the new law limits sales, purchases, mortgages, and formation of condominiums on properties that have not been demarcated by putting this requirement that the property is demarcated (deslinde) as the paramount requirement. `Learn More <https://www.selectcaribbean.com/deslinde-process/>`__
