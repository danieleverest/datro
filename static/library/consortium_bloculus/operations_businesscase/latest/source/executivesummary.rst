Executive Summary 
====================

Since 2016 the DATRO Consortium has been conducting trials of a new web 3.0 fixed communications infrastructure, along a 70km caribbean coastline entitled the "Scottish Bay".
This new network is made up of geodesic communications equipment rooms (entitled "domes"), which are solar powered and mesh together using a radio solution provided by Althea, California.
The purpose of this document is to introduce the Bloculus protocol and the business model and subsequent business opportunities which surround it.

Issue
~~~~~~~
Two challenges have had be overcome for this innovative new communications infrastructure to exist:  

1. Each newly constructed communications room ("dome") must be able to autonomously find its neighbours and establish a radio link   

2. After establishing a secure radio link, the web 3.0 services contained within each dome e.g. decentralized messaging, file storage etc - must be able to autonomously pair to the corresponding one in the neighbouring dome(s) 


Instead of consuming expensive engineering labour, manually establishing line-of-sight radio links and consulting authorities for licences, 
DATRO's network will use omnidirectional antennas, unlicenced radio frequencies and use its own protocol and automated software scripts and programs.   

Developing the technology isn't the only challenge. The business and financing has to continue to develop.
In addition to a protocol being developed to overcome the above challenges, the protocol has to be exclusively owned/controlled by the DATRO Consortium so that usage can be leased in order to generate revenue.  
In todays world it's simple for anything digital to be ripped off, cloned etc. So how can the aformentioned protocol be exclusively owned and controlled ?

Solution & Outcomes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The word Bloculus is made of two key words which best describe this new protocol:
 - 'Bloc' is a referece to Blockchain, particularly the Polkadot blockchain, which is uses in this protocols day-to-day operations.
 - 'Loculus' is an architectural and biological reference, used to describe a "little place" and/or compartmentalisation.  

The Bloculus protocol works by combining Uber's hexagonal ("H3") grid reference system with the Top Level Domain platform: Handshake. 
The result is a dedicated Top Level Domain for each hexagonal grids unique reference.
In order to share in the excitement and opportuntities surrounding this new protocol, it's worth having a basic understanding of Ubers H3 system and the Handshake platform: 

There's a multitude of grid reference systems in operation e.g. Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) etc 
One of the most unique is Ubers H3 solution, which instead of referencing a point or square on a map it uses hexagonals, commonly known as "honeycombs". 
A key feature of H3 used by DATRO is called "resolution", which permits the size of these honeycombs to be selected from a shortlist.
For DATRO's new network, 500 meter long honeycombs are sufficient for a balance between security obscurity and location accuracy. 
The closest suitable resolution is therefore resolution 8, which sets the honeycombs lengths to 461 Meters.
Each of which has a dedicated and unique reference e.g. 8843a13687fffff

But use of these references isn't something which can be exclusively owned and controlled. 
Enter Handshake. To understand Handshake its best to first understand Top Level Domains (TLD's).
TLD's are unique in nature e.g. dot com (.com) for example is only able to be possesed by a single entity at any one time.
If two entities both provided the TLD .com at the same time, how would a network know which party's .com to direct traffic to when someone enteres a .com url into their browser ? 
.com used to be owned by the United States Department of Defense, but today it's operated by Verisign.
Until Handshake came along, you could only obtain a TLD through an expensive and lengthy processes ($130k - $180k and 6+ months) with ICANN (which also offered no guarentees). 
The Handshake platform has democratised and cheapened this process through what is known as a candle auction. Now registration only takes a few dollars and a couple of days.  

In the case of the bloculus protocol its possible to have a dedicated TLD for each H3 reference e.g. .8843a13687fffff  
The nodes running in the domes are categorised and these categories are listed as the domain name e.g. messaging.8843a13687fffff
And finally the name of the service running in the dome is listed as the subdomain e.g. matrix.messaging.8843a13687fffff 

The domes can now establish links autonomously, since the addressing system contains the physical location.
Next the services/ nodes running inside each dome can pair quickly by specifying the corresponding domain and subdomain. 


Market Potential
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

DATRO's approach is to sell 50% co-ownership (co-lessor rights) for a one time fixed sum of $500 USD per 460 meter honeycomb.
For this price the Scottish Bay alone will generate in the region of circa $1.4M USD of digital real estate inventory for the consortium to sell.
The area is defined by the 70km width of the coastline and the depth is inland as far as the west/southern boundaries of the two provinces which make up the Scottish Bay.    
The services and nodes inside each dome effectively become lessee's, using cryptocurrency smart contracts to lease use and enjoyment of the Bloculus protocol.
The proceeds of which will pool together and divide proportionately between the protocols lessors/ beneficiaries. 
Henceforth the Scottish Bay will become the first of many estates, of this new protocol.
Furthermore, the web3.0 services and nodes on this new fixed communications network, are expected to be the first of many types of digital lessee's which will pay to use the Bloculus protocol.


Recommendation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's recommended the consortium expand on this business case and produce a dedicated whitepaper on the technology. 
It would be wise to purchase the Scottish Bay's entire H3 references as TLD's, ahead of competing party.
Then select future regions of the world to ringfence H3/TLD's for use with this protocol.
The retail rate of co-ownership of the preceeding estate, should help towards this growing capital requirement, failing this investors maybe interested in financing this initiative.      

Moving forward the consortium will overlay the desired H3 grid onto a map of the Scottish Bay. 
A salesforce will sell the inventory to interested parties.
The lessor/lessee agreement will be as a cryptocurrency smart contract. 

A typical business case would see this estate divided into 2,800 honeycombs. 
In this example a capital investor purchases co-ownership of a quarter of this estate (700 H3 hexagons) for circa $350,000 USD ($500 per honeycomb). 
The first lessee is the aformentioned mesh network, which takes say 3 years to construct and begins earning in the region of $6M USD per annum for use/enjoyment of the protocol.
The benefactor which co-owns a quarter of the estate would receive $750,000 USD per annum in royalties.
At this juncture the currency invested would be USD but the currency generated by the network and paid to beneficiaries would be the cryptocurrency DOT (on the Polkadot blockchain).   
   

Justification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This protocol is justified from both a technical and business standpoint. 
The alternatives aren't half as effective and have limitations which this protocol overcomes. 
Furthermore this is a new generation of communications network and so a new protocol has had to be developed specifically because the existing technologies didn't suffice.
The Bloculus protocol is designed for a reality of automation, decentralization, anonymity, cryptographic security, currency and tokenized voting/ liquid democracy.


Annexures
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A suppliment or appendix to a written document. An annexure is an addition to something, often to a document. 
When used generally to simply mean something added, annexure is interchangeable with annex. More commonly used in Britain and India, where it often specifically refers to an addition to an official document.
