## An idea

make world.datro.xyz point to gh-pages/static/gui

make wayback.world.datro.xyz point to netlify/wayback/

but hold on. We want to do with docs what we're doing with gui
e.g. same gui for interfacing with 2 types of content

so we make wayback.datro.xyz show /static/library/
which will list content from archive.datro.xyz (e.g. netlify branch)  

perhaps the archives on netlify can be listed in a .json.
Then the java can be configured to load a different .json depending on the url.

If the url is library.datro.xyz then show datro.xyz/static/library/index.html and .json files
but if the url is wayback.datro.xyz then show datro.xyz/static/library/index.html and archive.datro.xyz/.json files

The issue we have is that it's not as staightforward as the gui is index.html and the content is .json
In fact, the gui is mostly served from .json . 
index.html pretty much just handled SEO, stylesheet and the logo and title.

Ideally we'd put the whole layout back into index.html
Then split each language segment into 2 iframes. 
The left iframe shows an index.html and .json featuring current content. 
The right iframe shows an index.html and .json from the other branch, featuring corresponding archived content. 

This would be monsterous, but it would work for now. 
This has to evolve organically and manually in this way to maintain a serverless solution. 
Furthermore this would be able to work nicely offline too.
