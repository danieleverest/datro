This Release (0.0.5)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **2021-05-08** - `The methodology for archiving old version was followed with v0.0.3, but the folder 0-0-3 was corrupt and missing the rst files, could recover from build/html but not a feasible exertion of energy, so deleted it instead.`  
- **2021-05-08** - `Minor edit - Added initial in the document author segment, since other people exist with the same first/last name.`  
- **2021-05-08** - `The source data seems to have an unwritten methodology for calculation accured interest on accounts, which doesn't appear to be followed in all cases - unwritten and unautomated being the key word (action required).`  
- **2021-05-08** - `Data had errors that were rectified e.g. some accounts did not have accured interest added for the years 2021 - and some accunts accured interest was miscalculated.`

Version 0.0.4
###############

- **2021-05-08** - `Where possible yyyy-mm-dd is used where no date is recorded to maintain formatting consistency in anticipation of Polkadot smart contract scraping.`
- **2021-05-08** - `Creditor data updated since last release (accured interest, latest deposits etc). Some accounts still require reconsiling and new credits exist that are not on record yet.`
- **2021-05-08** - `The content segment was extensive because each creditor had a dedicated entry. Solved this (merged two .rst's and changed header types). Now content segment is brief.`
