Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike most organisations, DATRO simultaniously operates its own bespoke and internal cryptocurrency banking system and services.
This new trend in tech business/ finance is most commonly refered to as a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO).
To fully understand this report, readers are advised to briefly research DAO's online e.g. Wikipedia

DATRO's DAO is also expected to be able to re-write this financial report each time a transaction occcurs in order it remains concurrent and as close to possible as the institutional method of changelogs, reports and document archiving. 
At the time of writing these reports are compiled by a system administrator to check processes and proceedures before going fully autonomous.
Furthermore the DATRO DAO is expected to be able to autonomously summarise changes and place a link to the previous report in the changelog (of the most recent report). 

This DAO is also expected to autonomously execute an alternative to written and signed legal agreements (encoded scripts known as cryptocurrency smart contracts).
Unique cryptographic addresses are also used to replace government issued identities to eliminate identity theft, fraud and corruption.
The concept of loans, interest and other such financial instruments surrounding promissory notes isn't new. 
But the decentralised, autonomous organisation (DAO) method is DATRO's prefered method of automating the transactions and record-keeping of this business area.
You may also see our DAO refered to as a DAS (Decentralised, Autonomous Society) due to the large number of stakeholders involved which constitute the organisation being a stand-alone society.
