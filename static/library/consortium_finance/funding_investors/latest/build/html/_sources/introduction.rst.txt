Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this document are the latest public records corresponding to the DATRO Consortium's investment accounts.  
This document also introduces readers to the concept of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and DATRO's Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO): Innovative technologies and methodologies adopted to manage investments in a way which outperforms the traditional, institutional approaches e.g. shares in a company and/or quarterly and/or annually dividends, via fiat currency using banks etc

DeFi & DAO
###########

The DATRO Consortium DAO is, by design, able to operate fully autonomously, with full anonymity and without any central point of control.
In this model, blockchain and cryptocurrency is used to manage ownership of the consortium, voting rights and distribution of royalties and interest to the consortiums various groups of beneficiaries - especially and including our investors.


The DATRO consortium comprises of a myriad of cryptocurrency smart contracts, making the DATRO Consortium what is known as a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation(DAO)'s.
The very solution DATRO is offering in order to free, democratise and decentralise access to internet is itself attempting to be built and maintained in a similarly free, democratic and decentralized way.  


DATRO's beneficiaries e.g. recipients of revenues are grouped into several cryptocurrency smart contracts e.g. developers, financeers (investors/ lenders), end-users etc. 
This publication focuses specifically on reporting the most recent activity, data and statuses of the investors accounts. The corresponding smart contract is then able to autonomously scrape this data from this latest publication in order to autonomously, annonomously, equitably and accurately (in real-time) distribute royalties from our network to our investors.


DATRO's revenue from our network, pool together into a top level 'escrow' smart contract, which (after singalling fees/ "gas") autonomously allocated 56% to an end-user smart contract, before distributing the remaining 44%, evenly, to the developer and financeer (investors and lenders) smart contracts, which in turn distribute funds accordingly. 
In the case of the financeers smart contract, the interest is proportionately settled as a matter of priority to curb compounding of accrued interest. The remaining balance is then distributed equitably to the investors as a base rate of interest e.g. 16.6% APR since the policy was introduced. 


Once the investors have received the base rate of interest, the remaining balance is distributed to investors in the form of royalties e.g. dividend of profits. 
The blockchain being considered for this role is Polkadot (particularly for its ability to scrape data) and its versatile and popular cryptocurrency: DOT.       

Cryptocurrency tokens are awarded to stakeholders in order to permit them eligability to receive these funds by signalling to the corresponding smart contract, the destination wallet address where the royalties are to be sent. Furthermore the tokens represent a fair vote in alterations to the groups corresponding smart contract.
