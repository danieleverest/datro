Executive Summary
*******************

The DATRO Consortium is a collection of technologies which work together to form a decentralised, democratic and fully autonomous communications network. 
Any member of the public can utalise the technologies in our portfolio to obtain access to the internet without paying a traditional Internet Service Provider (ISP).

A typical end-user would begin with our free software upgrade for wireless access points, called HotspotBnB. 
The HotspotBnB Software upgrade is fully-autonomous and can be obtained with full-anonymity (no credentials required).
Once installed the user can install applications to their wireless access point, in much the same way you would with Android and iOS on your mobile device.

We believe installing web-applications to your wireless access point is integral to making access to the internet free, democratic and decentralised.
An example application is Althea. A California-based startup, whos technology allow you to mesh your wireless access point with your neighbours and share your networks data consumption cost using cryptocurrency.  
We also incorporated JSECoin. A Cambridge(UK) based startup, whos technology allows you to mine cryptocurrency while accessing web-applications on your wireless access point.  

If the picture isn't clear yet, we are pioneering a free internet (self-)service - where billing becomes a thing of the past.
As you use the internet, the tokens required for your data consumption is paid for using tokens generated by your engagement with our software. 
There is no advertising in this model. Instead the reduntant processing power of the wireless devices connected to your upgraded wireless access point, is used to perform blockchain functions. 
The remuneration for these functions are intravenously credited to your wireless access point for the data being consumed e.g. free internet    

Opportunity
============


Problem Summary
-----------------

While internet itself is (questionably) open and transparent and free, access to the internet remains in the hands of centralised, undemocratic, monopolies.
  

Solution Summary
-----------------

It is now technologically possible for anyone, anywhere to setup access to the internet for themselves and their community and pay less (perhaps even $0, perhaps even earn $$$) and with a fully transparent and open(public) solution
A bridge is being created between the technology and practices of skilled internet service engineers and competent members of the general public. 

Market Summary
---------------

Access to the internet has been flatlining for years since the growth of the network is heavily dependant on a billing model whereby the end-user pays. 
For a % of the global population the cost per GB of data is still too expensive. However the value of connecting this demographic to the internet, is strong for those already connected e.g. preserving dying languages etc 
The solution proposed by DATRO hits a cross section of many markets, more than 4 of which are in the tens and hundreds of billions each year e.g. IoT, voice/data communications etc
It's possible to profit from connecting people to the internet, since the cruciendo of revenue paying for end-users internet is a margin which is expected to grow as the trend grows. 
So in 2020 - 2025 we will see monetisation of the network paying for the network. Then in 2025 - 2030 we will see an abudance of revenue being generated as the data consumption cost reduces and the monetisation methods are optimised and become more efficient e.g. profit opportunity (web 3.0 will help in this area)  

Competition
------------

Many in this field have tried and failed since we first presented our idea of free internet access (and internet as a human right) to the United Nations Telecommunications Union (in Dubai in 2012).
This is a marathon not a sprint. While profit is important for sustainability, the cause itself has to be treated as a non-profit too so that the effort continues regardless of funding. It is after all a humanitarian effort.
Competitiveness is something that has come and gone over the years. The fact remains that access to the internet is still not free and the whole world is still not fully connected. Until such time competitiveness is incosequential - this is a challenge like sword in the stone. Many have tried and failed. 
DATRO is an underdog in this race. We are careful to pace ourselves for the longhall - approaching this challenge too aggressively is what we have seen competitors do, depleating lots of funds without gaining the desired results. 
DATRO will have invested in the region of $1M between 2012 and 2022 and our collection of software tools and intellectual property remains one of the most plausible in the world in terms of achieving delivering a legal and lawful free internet solution. 

Overview
---------

Our hope is that the desire to receive internet for free is motivation enough for someone, somewhere to adopt our solutions. 
We expect the result to be so satisfactory for the end-user that they, by their own accord, help drive our solution into their communities.
Providing our solution is free, simple and well documented/ presented, we expect social media to do what it does as far as spreading our message.
There are phases to the ambition of our project:
 - Owners of the 50Million+ single board computers out there, to be early adopters and at least try our software and provide us feedback so we can improve it for public release.
 - Sustained usage of our solution - not just testing and feedback, but end-users that depend on our solution for sustained free internet access
 - Heards - Not just individual geeks and freaks, but a family or a community facility e.g. business, school, uni etc - depending on our solution for low-cost/free internet connectivity.    
 - Fanatics - People who are so in love with our solution they do their upmost to promote and share and facility others with our solution 

Why Us
-------

I am Sion. The Founder and CEO. I have been in communications and IT since I was 14, I am now 37 (at the time of writing this). 
My experience and training in various technologies is beyond a hobby - I was a cyber & electronic warfare engineer in the british armed forces for 5 years and have been a tech entreprenuer since 2007.
I have built a large network of people with the skills and experience to help me make this vision for free internet access a reality. 
Over the years my commitment has withstood the test of time and this project is being recognised for its store of value (viability for investment) and its future potential as a large-scale international employer of people, regardless of a myriad of socio-economic conditions (for example, we survived the 2020 global pandemic while many organisations went under forever). 


Expectations
==============

1. A small community grows around the product/ service. Allowing us to prove the revenue potential and attention retained by the technology. 
2. A small network grows which is able to sustain a regions communications while others fail e.g. earthquakes, cyber attacks etc - demonstrating our technical supremacy 
3. Traction and growth becomes more frictionless - we see networks springing up around the world, without our knowledge or participation - just people using the material and software we've published to gain for themselves what we have
4. Revolution - large scale adoption, abandonment of the traditional ISP and billing model worldwide

Forecast
---------

1. 2020 - 2025
2. 2025 - 2030
3. 2030 - 2035
4. 2035 - 2040

Financial Highlights by Year
-----------------------------

1. 2025 - $100M Revenue per annum (50% back to end-users, 50% shared between financeers and developers)
2. 2035 - $1B revenue per annum (why not. $2.5 per month per end-users. 1 Billion wireless access points in the world as of 2020 and growing)

Subsequently we would like to see the following (for the sake of simplicity): 

2026 = $100M, 2027 = $200M, 2028 = $300M, 2029 = $400M, 2030 = $500M, 2031 = $600M, 2032 = $700M, 2033 = $800M, 2034 = $900M, 2035 = $1Billion

Financing Needed
-----------------

2012 - 2020 = $1M seed funding (achieved) 
2020+ = $7.7M startup (sale of 15% equity)

Possibly a Series A - Subject to earnings.
