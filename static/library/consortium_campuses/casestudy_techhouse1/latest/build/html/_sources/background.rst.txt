Nomenclature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Throughout 2014 the DATRO Consortium occupied the property, referring to it as **Casa Llandovery**.
This was the name Sion gave his former private residence, where his son Milo was born (back in Stockeld Park, Yorkshire (North England)) the previous year.
Llandovery originates from the name of the Welsh town and private boarding school where Sion studied before attending college/ the military and becoming an engineer.
