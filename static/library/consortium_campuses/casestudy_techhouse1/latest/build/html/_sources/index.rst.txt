Situation Report: Campus One (2014)
=======================================

This document is case study of the DATRO Consortium "Campus One": A dedicated, off-grid, technology campus for our Consortium.
The document features releasenotes, which discuss administration of this document itself e.g. changes, version control, issues, etc. 
The layout of the document closely resembles a Prince 2 (project management methodology) highlight report - which as standard includes:
 - `plans vs performance`
 - `issues, risks and concerns` 
 - `plans moving forward`

Situated in the "Dominican Alps" - A group of ski lodge style villas, 6km beyond Jarabacoa town in the Dominican Republic.  
First visited by our consortium in 2011.     
This document is a brief report about the activities at what we now refer to as "Campus One".
