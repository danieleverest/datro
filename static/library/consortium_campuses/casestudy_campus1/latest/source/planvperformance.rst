Plan
============


Deal Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~

- 6 months lease in lieu of a purchase agreement:

Lease In Lieu of Purchase
################################

- `All lease payments (& security deposit) serve as a deductable amortization credit during the purchase agreement`
- `Duration of lease (in this case 6 months) serves as a trial run for both the buyer and seller prior to an amortization`


Assurances
#################

The deal plan was assured using the concept of a "Soft Probe" (whereby the Lessor/Seller is granted access to the Lessee's/Buyer's accounts, to determine fiscal credibility).
DATRO's working capital for that year, was proven to be in the region of $200k+ USD -/+ 10%.

The legitemacy of the source of this capital was also proven e.g. investments and loans (albeit no trading activity/ sales revenues etc)
One source of a 74,000 GBP investment was for example, from the sale of a UK asset (45 Gregory Ave, Breaston, England, DE72 3DJ), which sold for Â£135,750 GBP in 2014.
The above info provided the Lessor/ Seller with sufficient assurances to proceed with this deal plan, terms and the aforementioned payment schedules.
DATRO's investor/ creditor public reporting can be found in the `DATRO Consortium Document Library <https://datro.xyz/static/library/>`__


Business/Technolgy Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A dedicated 5 year plan was written in 2014 and can be found by visiting the following link. 
 

Name Plan

The DATRO Consortium will name the property **Casa Llandovery**.

Team Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The team generally worked together well to create a campus that ran like clockwork.
The main development and productivity happened in the loft, with Armani and Sion.
Outside of developing there was BBQ's in the evening, walks to the waterfall in the day.  
The team also went out in the local town for food and ordered takeaways from time to time. 
Movie nights and friends visiting, was also helpful to our wellbeing. 
Sadly there was a lot of security concerns and attacks at the time.


Staff Accomadation
###################

The Driver/ Villa Manager (Rafi) along with his wife and children were awarded a 3 room apartment in the local town, with underground parking. 
Rafis privelages were extended to use of a vehicle to commute home each evening and back each morning.

The Groundkeeper (Junior) occupied the groundkeepers property. 
His wife and child were permitted to be with him under special circumstances e.g. welfare, emergencies and subject to security threat levels at the campus.
Otherwise Junior would commute to see them in the local town on evening and weekends. With the cost of commuting being reflected in a weekly additional allowance.
