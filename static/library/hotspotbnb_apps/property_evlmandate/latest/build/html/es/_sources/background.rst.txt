Background
=============


EVL displays millions of real-estate listings internationally. 
The platform crawls the Internet and captures real-estate listings without a need to manually upload the information. 
The platform has a subscription service which allows subscribers to represent property listings as their “agents” prior to others being able to represent the listings. 
An opportunity is also being explored, for affiliate marketers to obtain subscriptions via trackable unique hyperlinks, which point to the website's agent-registration page. 


When affiliate marketers share these unique links with their social media followers, their contribution is recognised and they are remunerated by way of revenue sharing the earnings from the subscriptions they obtain.
Furthermore this affiliate marketing model is multi-tier, meaning a 3rd party is also able to generate and issue their associates and/or subordinates trackable links, subsequently incurring them a percentage of the subscription revenue paid out to their associates and/or subordinates. EVL is centrally controlled on Google Cloud making it a Web2.0 platform.
