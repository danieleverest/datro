"EVL displays millions of real-estate listings internationally. The "
"platform crawls the Internet and captures real-estate listings without a "
"need to manually upload the information. The platform has a subscription "
"service which allows subscribers to represent property listings as their "
"“agents” prior to others being able to represent the listings. An "
"opportunity is also being explored, for affiliate marketers to obtain "
"subscriptions via trackable unique hyperlinks, which point to the "
"website's agent-registration page."

#: ../../source/background.rst:11
msgid ""
"When affiliate marketers share these unique links with their social media"
" followers, their contribution is recognised and they are remunerated by "
"way of revenue sharing the earnings from the subscriptions they obtain. "
"Furthermore this affiliate marketing model is multi-tier, meaning a 3rd "
"party is also able to generate and issue their associates and/or "
"subordinates trackable links, subsequently incurring them a percentage of"
" the subscription revenue paid out to their associates and/or "
"subordinates. EVL is centrally controlled on Google Cloud making it a "
"Web2.0 platform."

"The company now seeks to decentralize the platform in order to become "

"to enhance the platform's existing capabilities and offerings, in "
"addition to the extra security and  resilience decentralization provides."
" The core upgrade focuses on anonymity, secure messaging and "
"cryptocurrency instruments in order to facilitate users engaging and "
"transacting with one another, without needing to leave the platform. This"
