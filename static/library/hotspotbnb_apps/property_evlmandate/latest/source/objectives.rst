Objectives
============

The company now seeks to decentralize the platform in order to become Web3.0. 
Furthermore the many benefits of the blockchain, cryptocurrency, smart contracts, NFTâ€™s and so forth, will be taken advantage of in order to enhance the platform's existing capabilities and offerings, in addition to the extra security and  resilience decentralization provides. 
The core upgrade focuses on anonymity, secure messaging and cryptocurrency instruments in order to facilitate users engaging and transacting with one another, without needing to leave the platform. This move to web3.0 seeks to make EVL a pioneering one-stop-shop to view, lease/sell, rent and/or buy land and properties.
