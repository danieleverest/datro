Purpose
=========

This document is designed to portray the exact business solution EVL is looking to have developed, in as much detail as possible. 
This will then give EVL a point of reference for the relationship between the overall business strategy and any projects derived from this document. 
This Project Mandate document will also define how EVL expects DATRO Consortium to deliver the solution in the least disruptive way possible by specifying the exact definition of each of those individual expectations. 


This Project Mandate also helps DATRO Consortium ensure that any concerns EVL have at this stage are responded to within the project brief (also referred to as the proposal). 


The information in this Project Mandate will trigger the starting-up of a Project (SU) process. The information contained in this document will then be used to construct the Project Brief. 
The Project Brief will then be used to plan the project and contribute towards the project plan documentation. 


EVL must be as detailed and exact in their expectations and requirements as possible as the end product delivered by the project team will meet the exact criteria set in this document. 
Any missing information can only be included throughout the project by way of a change request which will have an impact. 
Any change requests submitted will be responded to by the project manager who will raise an impact report which will detail the implication that the change request will have on the project. 
Only on approval of this report, by the project board can the change request be responded to. 


The purpose of the sections within this project mandate is as follows; 


Authority Responsible
-----------------------
Key individuals involved in this project will have various levels of authority on particular matters. 
For example the web developer will have authority on all matters concerning the website development however timings, 
quality expectation and task approval authority will come from the project manager whose authority can be overruled by the project board. 


This authority can be best represented by a hierarchy or levels of authority. 
Once set, each individual/organization will be assigned a level of authority so that their authority, as well as area of responsibility within the project is clear.


Background
-----------
The background section described how EVL’s online activity arrived at its current state with respect to business development. 
This helps clarify EVL's confidence in their own business moving forward and helps EVL understand why processes and configuration is the way it is. 
This background information can also help EVL identify other areas of development that may have been overlooked in the past so that these can also be included in the current business strategy and the projects within that strategy.


Objectives
-----------
This section describes the particular business objectives extracted from the strategy that EVL now wishes to have fulfilled, in full or in part, by EVL. 
These objectives can have sub-objectives and can even include the objective of having more objectives (and/or sub objectives) based on expertise that may be outside of EVL’s board's remit of knowledge. 
(e.g objective 1 – There needs to be a set of online marketing objectives that counter the competitors online marketing strategy based on the intelligence that can be gathered. 
This objective is to be fulfilled and continued by the project team commissioned to execute the project.)


Scope
------
The scope section best describes the boundaries of EVL's wealth of expertise and resources and helps clarify the arcs of capability to the project team as well as their own company. 
This will help ensure that any resources within EVL are considered for utilization in the execution of the strategy before any labor is requested from external agencies. 
Defining the internal resources and how and when they may be available for use, in addition to the factoring the workload balance may be also helpful to clarify to the project team what existing resources can be utilized for the execution of the objective and overall strategy. 
In this section EVL must describe the major deliverables of the Project along with specific products, which are not part of the Project. 
Describe the major dependencies (which impact on the project during its life) and interdependencies, which will exist after implementation.

Constraints
------------
Known constraints will help clarify the reality of the surrounding environment of EVL, DATRO Consortium and the project team and its resources in order to successfully achieve the goals and objectives by ensuring no limiting factors are left out of the equation. 
Constraints to consider can be anything from financial, politicalor environmental to technical, legal, commercial etc. 
In any case all known constraints should surface into this document as later exposure to constraints may have serious implications that can affect the project goals and objectives.


Interfaces
-----------
Information regarding EVL’s preferences surrounding interfaces (e.g- user login portals, front end website design etc) should be included in this section in as much detail as possible. 
This will help the project team ensure that after functionality has been achieved by the project team, the way EVL interacts with the controls will be in compliance with their requirements which will be outlined in this section in as much detail as possible. 


Quality Expectation
--------------------
EVL’s quality expectation should be detailed in this section as clearly as possible so that the project team includes these expectations in the quality control guide of the project. 
This will ensure that all work approved meets the quality expectation as well as the objectives. 
This is by far the most important section of the entire document and must be completed in as much detail as possible by EVL.


Outline Business Case
------------------------
Describe the business outcomes and service/works requirements in a way that is unambiguous. 
Ensure that the total project scope is described. 
Requirements should usually be specified in terms of outcome, based on 'what' rather than 'how'. 


Associated Documentation
---------------------------
All EVL’s material in relation to this mandate should be enclosed and referenced with this document. 
This will help clarify the descriptions given in this document as well as aiding the project team in visualizing the current status of the company. 


Proposed Project Board
-------------------------
EVL is to put forward their proposed executives in this section that will then be included in the construction of the project board and project management team. 
These individuals will have decision making responsibilities that form an axis on which the success of the project will be determined. 
It is also recommended that any second in command personnel are included to ensure contingency plans are not executed should the primary decision maker be unresponsive throughout the project.


Customers and Users
---------------------
Insert the names of all known users; customers and any other interested parties as well as their specific relationship to this project and the overall strategy.(e.g - existing ecommerce customers and booking details that will need to be migrated to the new system. 


Approvals
------------
All approving parties named in the approvals section above must sign to authorize this document as it also serves as a legally binding agreement and point of reference when referring to “What the customer wanted”.
