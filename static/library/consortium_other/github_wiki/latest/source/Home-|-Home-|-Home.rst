Welcome to the DATRO Wiki! Our mission here at DATRO is to free, democratize & decentralize our ability to communicate digitally e.g. access to the internet. Right now we pay, so it's an affordable privilege, our communications mostly goes through a corporate/privately owned internet service provider, who dictate the service and terms to the public, which has usually been dictated to them by a central Government and/or bank - And in a lot of cases, to the users complete detriment and dissatisfaction. [Learn More](https://datro.world)

To join this revolution, begin with [HotspotBnB](http://hbnb.datro.world/): Our free & universal software upgrade for your wireless access point. (Also works on most other Linux Debian supported devices, such as the Raspberry Pi's (all models)). This software upgrade will allow you to install and host applications on your wireless access point. The HotspotBnB App Store features a range of cutting edge web app and a stylish and modern dashboard to access and manage them. With a few apps installed your wireless access point will transform into a smart home hub, featuring gaming, iptv & media center entertainment, energy & ipcctv monitoring and more. HotspotBnB also features an opt-in cryptocurrency mining feature, used for the Wave application.  

Wave is a Decentralized Application (DApp) on the HotspotBnB App Store. It enables you to forward the cryptocurrency being mined on your home network, to your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This DApp is subsequently able to reduce your monthly internet bill. In some cases by as much as 100% e.g. free internet access. It all depends on your monthly usage of your newly upgrade wireless access point.

Then we have a few other solution which help secure, decentralize and democratize our software solutions. Here's a summary of these additional solutions DATRO is developing:

* To-Go USB - A disk image for a USB Dongle. It creates a pre-configured work environment, giving anyone anywhere the tools and development environment they need to collaborate on this project. No more need to change settings or install work software onto your laptop, just copy our persistent live disk image to a usb dongle and reboot your machine and it's just like you've visited our offices and booted up one of our workstations. 

* 'Scottish Bay' Decentralised Autonomous Society (DAS) - Revenue is mined from our network and distributed to ISP's and developers fully autonomously using cryptocurrency smart contracts and the blockchain. These types of autonomous organisations are commonly known as DAO's (Decentralised Autonomous Organisations), but our stakeholders exceed 5,000 and subsequently constitute this DAO being a society and not just an organisation, hence the abbreviation DAS. The term Scottish Bay comes from the Caribbean coastline from where this technology is being developed and trialed. 

* Proxy Cache - A disk image for use on offline networks. Our Proxy Cache simulates internet access, tricking the autonomous self-building HotspotBnB NetInstaller, to think there's internet when there isn't, in order for it to upgrade a wireless access point, install a mesh network application and join a nearby mesh network, and/or download Wave, to get free internet access from the second the new user joins the network. 

* Monorepo - We're proud to announce that everything listed above and more, including compiled technical documents and our websites, training videos etc, are all stored in a single public directory (repository), which uses industry standard methodologies to manage changes and release (CHANGELOG, Semantic version etc)
