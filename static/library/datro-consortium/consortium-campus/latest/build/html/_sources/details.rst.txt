Information
============  
  
This report (and reference to the plot of land in question) has been entitled "Jam Highland":
 - "Jam" since the plots official name is presumed to be "El Jamito" (and the connecting roads presumed name: "Jamito"). This can be seen in the :ref:`General Plan (Preview)` below.  
 - "Highland" since the plot is a hill and the coastline where it's situated is official named "Bahía Escocesa" (`Scottish Bay <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Bay>`__).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Location: `Google Maps Location <https://goo.gl/maps/1zAx8ZeceHtPVksJ8>`__ (19.287486,-69.543597) - source: :ref:`Sotherby Market Analysis (Preview)`

   we (turn right and) travel (uphill, Eastwards) 400m. And on the left we find the project (a large hill)

Surmises
~~~~~~~~~~

 - Connecting road (adjacent to plot), while undeveloped and still a gravel track, is actually a throughfair:
    -  South/West exit from plot entrance leads to: Carretera Las Terrenas - Sanchez, Las Terrenas
    -  North/East exit from plot entrance leads to: UNKNOWN AT THIS STAGE
 - Plans supposedly exist to develop the road and throughfair, as has been done is the surrounding area already 
 - No leans reported on the land/ titles (certificate of clearenace is obtainable, subject to buyers preference/request) 
 - Current owner has purchased all 5 titles from previous owner - lawfirm will confirm
