# Changelog
It's expected that developers log all changes to this directory, in this CHANGELOG.md file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1-rtw.8] - Q3/2020

### Added
- Copyleft notice and website url, in the bottom center

### Changed
- This changelog now reflects the new filename and our custom extension (`rtw`), of this branches semantic version ID
- Hopefully all the inbound links to this 'gui' (formerly 'demo') are updated now. See their respective changelogs
- Breadcrumb on app store, it was a bit close to the edge. I brought it in a bit (5vw)
- 12-Sep - changed the title font-size and margin from px, to em, since it was looking stupidly small on mobile.

### Fixed
- The mouse curstor wasn't always catching the budger button. Fixed it

## [0.0.1-rtw.7] - 2020-06-04

### Added
- Ability to change dashboard logo text to whatever user wants (local storage cache)

### Changed
- dashboard logo positioning, it was to far right on mobile devices, adjusted it so its centered
- made logo text disspear on narror screens (300px less). Sanity over vanity.  

### Removed
-

### Fixed
- burger menu icon would dissapear on some mobile devices and end up towards the middle on larger screen devices. Fixed it
- icons in the app-store
