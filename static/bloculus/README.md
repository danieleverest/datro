# DATRO Consortium: Bloculus

Bloculus is a new protocol being developed for the trial mesh network on the Scottish Bay, DR.  
At the time of writing this, we're using Ubers H3 Hexagon/Honeycomb grid, overlayed onto an OpenMap of the María Trinidad Sánchez and Samana Province e.g. Scottish Bay   
Each honeycomb grid reference will be registed as a Top Level Domain.  
We anticiplate the "resolution" to be that of a honeycomb every 50 meters or so.  
Each Geodesic communications equipment room will utalize the H3-TLD within its proximity to automate mesh network handshakes and links between each web3.0 service/ node running from the location e.g.  messaging.h3ref , ipfs.h3ref  
With the Top Level Domain and Domain name taken care of, we now add the specific service as a subdomain e.g. matrix.messaging.h3ref , filecoin.ipfs.h3ref etc
