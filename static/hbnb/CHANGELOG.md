# Changelog
It's expected that developers log all changes to this directory, in this CHANGELOG.md file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.2] - Q4/2020

### Added
13-Dec - Changed all instances of 'HotspotBnB' to 'Hotspotβnβ'

### Changed

10-Oct - Changed the github.com release url, from the hbnb repo, to the datro repo
         inacurate according to our semantic release methodology and nomenclature, but it's only temporary
         at least until the hbnb net installer source code branch is moved from hbnb to datro 

## [0.0.1] - Q3/2020

### Added
00-Ooo - put some css into the header to allow scrolling, but hide the scrollbars
00-Ooo - it should be in the css, but one step at a time. Will try that next, but not on the main (on the beta)

### Changed
13-Sep - got rid of a horizontal scrollbar which was very apparent against the contrasting footer color. 

### Fixed
