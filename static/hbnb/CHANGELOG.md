## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] - Q3/2020

### Added
- put some css into the header to allow scrolling, but hide the scrollbars
- it should be in the css, but one step at a time. Will try that next, but not on the main (on the beta)

### Changed
13-Sep - got rid of a horizontal scrollbar which was very apparent against the contrasting footer color. 

### Fixed
