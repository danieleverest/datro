## [Unreleased]

## [-html-videos-0.2] - Q2/2021

### Fixed
05-May - Mistakenly deleted package.json-lock file. It broke the video playback on the landing page. re-instated it.
05-May - Security Vunerability in dependancy - package xmlhttprequest - updated to latest which has fix (v1.6.2) (in json file)  


## [-html-videos-0.1] - 2020-09-09

### Added
    - The source of this video player solutions is https://freshman.tech/custom-html5-video/  
    - 

### Changed
    - added two div's (left and right side of video), so that mousing over the video reveals the player  
    - the reason there's a gap in the middle, is so that the play/pause still works when you click on the video  
    - had there not been a gap, you'd not be able to start/stop the video by clicking it. which is how most people do it I guess
