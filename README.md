  - Serverless: Makes the business very resilient to physical/ cyber attacks:
     - anyone wanting to collaborate on the website can (see COLLABORATE.md)

  - the corresponding dynamic server-side files allow the cms for the website to be locally hosted e.g. run offline
  - the DATRO persistent-live USB disk image is also provided, to turn any PC into a fully-configured local workstation
  - Make changes, follow the sites COLLABORATE.md guide e.g. directly edit the source code or use the cms and its html export feature)
  - once you're done making changes, upload your changes to github and make a pull request to the `gh-pages-dev' branch.
